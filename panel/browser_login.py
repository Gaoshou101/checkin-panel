	Three shapes, because a page that wants hands does not always say so. A login *page*
	names itself, and ~10s of redirects is plenty before believing one. But
	`connect.linux.do` renders whatever it wants at `/oauth2/authorize` — measured:
	Cloudflare answers that URL with a `Just a moment...` challenge — so the tab sits on an
	authorize URL that looks exactly like a consent page we are about to click. Nothing
	there matches `/login`, so a URL check never fires and the run burns the full 120s to
	reach a TimeoutError that names no cause.

	`progress` is a checkbox click this tick, and it only ever excuses the *stall* shapes.
	It must never excuse the first one: the IdP's own login page means the session in this
	profile is gone, and no amount of clicking renews it. Measured 2026-09-14 on grok-heavy
	(the whole failure): the OAuth hop bounced `linux.do/session/sso_provider` →
	`linux.do/login`, that login page rendered its own Turnstile widget, `_click_turnstile`
	found and clicked its checkbox, and the resulting `progress` suppressed this verdict
	every tick — so a run that could have said 「需要先人工登录一次」 in 10s instead spent the
	full 600s and reported 页面一直在动, which was also untrue.

	So the second shape is simply **nothing moving**: no page changed URL for ~30s. A
	consent page does not do that — we click it every tick and it navigates. Only a
	challenge or a form waiting for hands does.

	Not a challenge, though: the poll loop lets a *present* one hold this counter back
	(`_challenge_present`), because a managed challenge stops everything for minutes and
	then clears on its own. What reaches here as "nothing moving" is the tab with neither
	movement nor a challenge on it — and the deadline, not this check, is what ends a
	challenge that never clears.

	The third is the same stall on the *site's own* pages, and it is a separate branch
	because `_idp_pages` excludes them by construction: it keeps the tabs whose URL does
	not contain `root`. A challenge served by the check-in site itself therefore left the
	stall detector with an empty list and reported nothing (measured on gorouter.app: the
	whole 120s spent, then a bare timeout). Which side stalled changes the advice, so the
	two branches say different things; the site's own challenge is worth another go, and
	the run's own bounded retry now issues one.

	— a box that can render a beat *after* the button does, so one pass at ticking it loses

	opens with a 系统公告 modal (`.semi-modal-wrap`, `position: fixed`, `z-index: 1000`) whose
	body paragraph lands across the OAuth buttons, which is what `dismiss_popups` is for.

	Ready therefore means "receives events", not `is_enabled()`. A covered button *is*
	enabled, so the old check returned in 0.0s while the page was still a skeleton and the

	Playwright performs, and reported it as the button not being there at all.

	And **twice in a row**, half a second apart, because one look is satisfied by the moment
	before the page has finished happening. Measured on anyrouter.top: at t=0.0 the buttons
	are drawn over a Semi skeleton and nothing is over them, at t=0.5 the 公告 modal is up.
	A single look returns in that first instant and the click lands on a button whose handler
	cannot do anything yet — the card is still waiting for the site status `_forget_spa_login`
	cleared, so it has no OAuth URL to go to. That click *succeeds* mechanically and the run
	then dies 30s later in the poll loop, reporting a stall on a page it never left. Two
	consecutive looks cost half a second on a page that was ready all along.

	The fourth is a Cloudflare challenge **on this page**, one the button never becomes

	which is reached after a button click has already succeeded — so on a site serving the
