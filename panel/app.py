"""FastAPI application for the Check-in Panel.

Serves the REST API and (in production) the built React frontend. There is **no
authentication layer** (ADR-0003), and `/api/accounts` hands back whole `Account`
rows — passwords and sessions included. Whatever the panel is bound to is therefore
the trust boundary, and it is not always loopback: `run.py` defaults to `0.0.0.0`
(LAN-reachable) while the container defaults to `127.0.0.1`. Publishing the port to
an untrusted network publishes the credentials with it.
