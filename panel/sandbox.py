"""The startup sequence every way of running the panel shares (ADR-0016).

Entry points need the same environment before anything else happens: `run.py` and the container. This module is the single copy of that sequence —
duplicating it would mean two copies of the loopback fix, and one of them would rot.

Order is load-bearing, not stylistic:

1. `sys.stdout` line buffering, or the scheduler's prints sit in a buffer for hours.
2. `loopback.install()` **before anything builds an event loop** (ADR-0014). uvicorn, a
   bare `asyncio.run` and every async test die at startup without it on this machine.
3. Sandbox paths as env defaults (ADR-0006) — `setdefault`, so a real env var still wins.

There used to be a step here that put `anyrouter-check-in/` on `sys.path` for the cloakbrowser
helpers. Those five files are vendored in `panel/vendor/utils/` now, so they import as an ordinary
subpackage and nothing has to be arranged before the import works.

Two roots, not one. `root` is where the panel *writes* — `data/panel.db`, `.browser_profiles/`,
the browser cache — and `assets` is where read-only bundled files were unpacked. They are the
same folder in a git checkout and in the container, and differ only in a frozen build, where
`sys._MEIPASS` is a temp directory that is deleted on exit: resolving the database against it
would put every run's accounts somewhere new and then throw them away.

Deliberately imports neither fastapi nor uvicorn: it has to be callable before they are
imported, which is the whole point of step 2.
