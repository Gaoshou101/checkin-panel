"""Protocol-level New API client — no browser, no UI automation.

Every New API / One API fork exposes the same public surface:

	GET  /api/status      capability discovery (oauth methods, quota_per_unit)
	POST /api/user/login  {username, password} -> `session` cookie + user data
	GET  /api/user/self   balance; also accepts an access token
	PUT  /api/user/self   set username/password (session-authenticated)

Check-in comes in two flavours, and the probe decides which:

	endpoint     — the site registers a check-in route; POST it.
	login_bonus  — no route; a *fresh login* credits the daily bonus and the
	               login response carries `checked_in`.

Verified against agentrouter.org: its SPA reads `data.checked_in` from the
plain password-login response, so login_bonus needs no OAuth at all.
