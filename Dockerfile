# --legacy-peer-deps is not a container workaround: plain `npm ci` fails on the host too
# (measured). `@heroui/theme@2.4.26` declares `peerDependencies: tailwindcss >=4.0.0` while
# the project is on `tailwindcss@^3.4.17`, so npm 7+ refuses the tree that `node_modules/` was
# actually installed with. This flag reproduces that same tree rather than papering over a
# difference. The real fix is a frontend decision -- tailwind v4, or a @heroui/theme that
# accepts v3 -- and does not belong to packaging.
